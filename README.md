# HESEIA Sentence Bias Dataset

This repository contains the datasets collected during the teacher training course HESEIA Sentence Bias (Tools for Exploring Biases and Artificial Intelligence). organized by V√≠a Libre, the Ministry of Education, and FAMAF-UNC. The course had an initial enrollment of 370 participating teachers, who also involved 5,000 students in building a dataset that reflects stereotypes present in Argentina. The datasets include anonymized CSV files of data logged during our 5-month long course with high school teachers in C√≥rdoba, Argentina, during 2024.

The data collection process was designed collaboratively, in close coordination with the teachers. As part of this approach, an informed consent form was developed, which you can access [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v7XTX7pFJ8SUv0JbwY5yXsISH61k5GRWdDqWz6PFrls/edit?usp=sharing).
It is important to emphasize that the creation of the data was carried out through a collective construction process, avoiding extractivist practices. 

For this reason, beyond its value as a resource, it is essential to understand the context and methodology behind its development.

If you would like to learn more about the course and its implementation, you can access further information [here](https://www.vialibre.org.ar/masiva-convocatoria-al-curso-de-extension/).
This project was made possible thanks to the support of f<A+i>r de Alliance, the Data Empowerment Fund, Mozilla's Data Futures Lab, and Google Academic.
